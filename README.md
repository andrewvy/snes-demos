# SNES Demo

Repository for experimenting and learning how to program for the SNES (65816)!

Uses [ca65](http://cc65.github.io/doc/ca65.html), assembler for the MOS 6502 microprocessors.

### How to Run

`brew install cc65`

`./build.sh`

You should find a `.smc` ROM built in the `build/` folder, which you can open up on your favorite emulator.
